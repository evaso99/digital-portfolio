```{tab-item} Things I learned
- learned how to write a coverletter in markdown format. The block quote, warning/note syntax are especially interesting.
- learned how to hide input cells in the jupyter book. This is useful when the input code is too long and distracts viewer from the output graph
```

```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
- the whole adding a figure + editing the figure's size + adding caption and cross-references process. Each individual step is not difficult but chaining them together took some time
- it took a long time to figure out how to rebuild the book after step 6. Had to get help from piazza eventually.
